# Offensive-Golang
Hacking with Go! This is a repo where I will store my small projects as I learn Golang.

Templates and code for useful hacking-related stuff in Golang will be placed in this repository. It has been created simply so I have some where to store my scripts and snippets. This repo has deliberately been separated into smaller code applications so that each function is it's own program. This makes is easy for anyone else to jump in and use and of the code.


Feel free to use, copy and share
